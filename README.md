# Html_css_js_Basics

I created this project in order to learn come basics about HTML, CSS and Javascript.

There are 2 panels on the screen:
- a pink one where you insert a number and you press a button to check if the number is even or odd and the result is shown below the button;
- a purple one where you can see the number's history (what numbers you checked) as a list.

The panels expand once the list in the history panel increases.
